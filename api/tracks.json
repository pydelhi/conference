Most of them think its the worst part of Python. I will try to demonstrate how it actually works and how we can leverage multiple CPU cores for multithreading for I/O and CPU Bound task using C-Extensions. I will also show some comparisons with different implementations of Python and the presence or absence of GIL in those, to answer questions like, why we can't just remove it from CPython and solve all our problems or why Jython performs better in Multithreading for CPU Bound task.",

				"description": "In Python 3.0, concurrent programming takes many forms. One can go with traditional threads using the threading module or perform process based parallelism using the multiprocessing module. However Python 3.x also comes with concurrent futures a way to parallelize your code using multiple threads or processes and receive the results in a future object - combining parallel processing with asynchronous execution - Pretty elegant! Wait - there is also the asyncio module with its support for Asynchronous execution - for executing tasks truly asynchronously but with zero parallelism. It is an exciting way of execution typically in one thread but covering multiple tasks bit by bit - in a truly concurrent fashion. This module introduces new ways of creating co-routines using the exciting async and await keywords. The talk will also explore a few libraries outside core Python - especially we will look at an example of parallelizing execution of a Fractal generation program using multiple cores using PyMP - which is inspired by OpenMP. We will also briefly explore asynchronous programming with Twisted and also look at some examples using Gevent/Eventlet towards end of the workshop. The aim of the workshop is to introduce concurrency and parallel programming to it via Python 3.x. We will be touching upon the basics such as GIL, concurrency vs parallelism etc with real world examples and analogies, so even if you are new to the entire topic, the workshop should suit you.",

One believes in shared memory and embraces all the complexities that come bundled with it like mutexes, locks and inter-process communication. The other believes in message passing meaning that threads/processes interact explicitly by sending messages and do not share state. The speaker firmly believes in the message passing school because of its simplicity over shared memory and intends to convert every person in the room through this talk. ZeroMQ allows you to write concise and easy to understand multi threaded code that simulates the message passing model. Your threads dont share state, they communicate only by passing messages. This allows you to later split your threads into separate processes as your application needs evolve.",

				"title": "Creating Image Thumbnails using AWS Lamda",
				"description": "Amazon web services has a feature which has been doing rounds that is AWS Lambda which allows to instantly react to actions carried in other AWS services, HTTP endpoints, or in-app activity. You can use AWS Lambda to run your code in response to events, such as changes to data in an Amazon S3 bucket or an Amazon DynamoDB table; to run your code in response to HTTP requests using Amazon API Gateway; or invoke your code using API calls made using AWS SDKs. When using AWS Lambda, you are responsible only for your code. AWS Lambda manages the compute fleet that offers a balance of memory, CPU, network, and other resources. So it is very convenient and fast and saves a lot of sweat but implementing it can become a pain if you follow amazon docs by the book.Thumbnail creation of images as a reaction to putting images in S3 is the use case I will be demonstraing to explain how AWS Lambda works.",

				"title": "An Introduction to Bayesian Statistics for the Python Programmer (no data science experience needed) ",
				"description": "The legendary economist Paul Samuelson once said, “When my information changes, I alter my conclusions. What do you do, sir?” When new data comes along, a smart man will change his opinion in response to it, rather than clinging to his old opinion when it no longer fits the facts. Bayesian statistics is the mathematically optimal way to change one’s opinions in response to new data. In this talk I’ll provide a pythonic, rather than mathematical, introduction to Bayesian statistics. The target audience is programmers, not data scientists. I’ll show how a numpy array can be used to represent our opinion about the world. I’ll then show how we can use Bayesian statistics to change our opinion when we gain new information. A number of examples will be used for illustration, including disease prediction, compass calibration and detecting errors in production systems. ",
